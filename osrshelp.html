        <p>At 28 thieving, you are able to loot 2 chests in East Ardougne containing 3 coins and a Nature Rune:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>One is located up the ladder in the cooking range house south of the north bank</li>
          <li>Another is located upstairs in the house just east of the gem stall (It is the north most chest in the room).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This timer will notify you when the chest is ready to be looted again:</p>
        <p>Note: It takes 8 seconds for the rune to respawn, however an animation plays upon clicking to delay the respawn timer. This accounted for in this timer.</p>
